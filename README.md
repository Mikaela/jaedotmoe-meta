# Meta repo

Greetings, this is a *meta* repo which means it is used to track public stuff about myself (Jae Lo Presti).  
If you wish to see the current tasks being tracked, please see the [issues section of the repo](https://github.com/Jaedotmoe/meta/issues).

This repo also contains a backup of all my blog posts.
