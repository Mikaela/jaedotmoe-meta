# 2022 Software

Hey everyone, it's that time of the year again, time to show what software I use every day.

First off, let's start with the OS. I mainly use ArchLinux x86_64 with the Linux-pf Kernel with some minor tweaking. As for the window manager/desktop environment, trusty XFCE4 is still standing after all of those years.

When it comes to the dev setup, I am using Sublime Text (with a legit licence for once) which is in my opinion one of the best editors out there. As for the terminal emulator, Kitty is in use with ZSH (& OMZ) and Starship for the prompt.

On the browser side, nothing really changed, Firefox is still the browser of choice. However, the search engine has shifted to Kagi as the search results are now more relevant than Google's on my search queries.

That's basically it for the software for this year, and I'll see you next time!
