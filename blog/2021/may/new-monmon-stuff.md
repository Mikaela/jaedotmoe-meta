# New Monmon stuff

Hey everyone, just a small post to say that two new Monmon pages dropped yesterday. If you are not familiar with those, it is a parody of Pok√©mon mainly made in Paint.net and where drawing styles can change from one page to another.

Also, small disclaimer: the following texts may contain strong language for some people.

Of course, I'm not alone, it is made with a friend, Ray-Yami, don't forget to check out [their Twitter account](https://twitr.gq/25dropsrayyami)!

And that's all for today's episodes! The full series is available on [Mangadraft (in French)](https://www.mangadraft.com/bd/monmon-laventure-bizarre).

As you may have seen, I tried to complete ALT tags on this page, if you want to give some feedback, don't hesitate to join me on Matrix in my personal room (#home:jae.fi) or any common room we may already share.

I'll see you next time.
